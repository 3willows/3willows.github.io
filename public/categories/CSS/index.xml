      <description>I fell in love with the technology of CSS recently, having obsessively followed a YouTuber (and CSS guru) called Kevin Powell.&#xA;One of the articles that Kevin recommends is the Dao of Web Design.&#xA;In essence, the article argues that web as a medium is fundamentally different from printed media because the layout of a webpage has to work on so many different devices:&#xA;mobile phone, tablets, laptops, Desktops And also on different browswers with customisation such as dark reader or screen readers.</description>

      <description>Kevin Powell points out that people (certainly me!) tend to be too impatient with CSS.&#xA;They assume it is a “simple” technology and just resort to looking up answers on Google as they go along, without trying to understand the undelrying principles.&#xA;But paradoxically in CSS more than in (say) Javascript, fundamentals matter even more.&#xA;The layout of a web page differs from device to device and from browser to browser.</description>
