title: "Fireship.io: SvelteKit Full Course"
---

I had a coffee with a Frontend developer on Monday, and he was telling me how he finds playing with Angular helped him understand React better. 

Another framework he mentioned is Svelte.  It is something I always wanted to try out, so I decide to give the official [quick start tutorial](https://learn.svelte.dev/tutorial/welcome-to-svelte) a spin.  I started from the beginning and stopped at around the "bindings" part.

It is a very easy framework to get the hang of!  Compare with React, the set-up costs is much lower: the syntax is a lot more similar than plain Javascript and HTML, and the file structure is also easier to take in for beginners.  

To try out a full project, I chose Fireship.io's [SvelteKit Full Course](https://fireship.io/courses/sveltekit/) after watching his YouTube video on Svelte for React Developers.

Just like his wonderful "Code in 100 seconds", the pace is very fast and the delivery pleasant.  I followed along to everything up to the end of "User Management", which already allows me to play with a simple slide-bar outlining the steps to user authentication.

For the rest, I am likely to just watch the videos first, and then decide to what extent I want to dive deeper.  I have recently started a volunteer project using the Next + Supabase stack, so I should devote more time to that.
