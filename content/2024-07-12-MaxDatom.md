title: "Max Datom levels 1 to 5"
---

I heard about this [game](https://max-datom.com/) in a Clojure dojo and wanted to give it a spin.

It is an interactive tutorial of [Datomic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datomic), a databse assoicated with Clojure.  

While it is not a technology I am likely to use, the story line was engaging and I ended up spending a morning on it.

My takeaway from [levels 1 to 5](https://github.com/3willows/maxdatom) is the truism that, in broad outlines, database systems need to fulfill the same kind of tasks.  For example, users need to be able to find "a variable (that) appears in more than one data pattern": a concept known as ["unification"](https://docs.datomic.com/query/query-executing.html#unification) in Datomic.  Part of the interest in trying out different languages/systems is seeing how different ways to solve the same problem. 

Not entirely sure if I have the time/skills to play it to the end (according to [this post](https://clojurians-log.clojureverse.org/datomic/2022-07-15), it takes a few horus for experienced developers but up to a day for the less experienced).  

Perhaps best to save it as an activity for my next dojo.
