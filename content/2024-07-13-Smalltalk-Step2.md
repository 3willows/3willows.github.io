Richard Kenneth Eng's [article](https://richardeng.medium.com/pharo-the-next-ten-minutes-a17899dc9a58) recommended [Learn Smalltalk with ProfStef](https://amber-lang.net/learn.html), which was easy to follow even without full concentration.

I wanted to try [gnu smalltalk](https://www.gnu.org/software/smalltalk/manual/html_node/Getting-started.html#Getting-started) next, but unforunately it was not yet available for [Apple chips](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/issues/162195).

Given that Pharo is available on Mac, the best next step is probably Pharo by Example 9 (updated 2022), which is freely downloadable [here](https://books.pharo.org/).
