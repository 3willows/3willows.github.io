A short time before I started following blogs with RSS, I came across [Dan Luu's blog](https://danluu.com/) (someone was referring to it as an example of a good looking blog with no CSS at all).

It was a treasure trove of well thought-out and very well-written essays.  And one of the most interesting pieces is about [search engines](https://danluu.com/seo-spam/), where (among others) Luu claims that one of the best search engines around is an indie project called [Marginalia Search](https://search.marginalia.nu/).

At first this piece of information washed over my mind.  But at times when I was frustrated with not finding the right results on Google, I tried Marginalia and the results were surprisingly useful.

One of the most dramatic examples happened today.  I was looking for a way to quickly deploy a bare-bones ClojureScript website (like [this](https://github.com/3willows/demo-clojurescript-gh-pages)).  But even the simplest YouTube walkthrough looked quite complicated. 

Google quickly (and correctly) returns a relevant [Stack Overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37667931/how-do-i-deploy-a-single-page-app-written-in-clojurescript-figwheel-to-a-stat).  

But the two top voted answers are complicated, involving running a custom-made bash script to deploy on github pages.  

I was looking for some kind of super-simple, no-brainer experience, like deploying a Next project on Vercel.  It seemed none was available.

Fortunately, I tried Marginalia and was immediately pointed to an excellent [step-by-step tutorial](https://betweentwoparens.com/blog/deploy-clojurescript-to-github-pages/).

Not sure whether this is just a fluke, but I will have a lot more time for Marginalia from now on.
