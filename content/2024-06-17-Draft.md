This is supposed to be a draft!

Sources and set up

- Video tutorials on Yelpcamp with Colt Steele, supplemented by Getting MEAN and the Daley book
- It is easier to test things with REST Client API (compared with Postman)

Basics of Express

- Node is the basis of Express.  That is why the tutorials tells you to run “node index.js” and later “nodemon index.js” to get the server going.
- Everything is wrapped up in objects.  The app object, the request (req) object, the response (res) object.
- The server is on the receiving end of things.  So it gets request objects from the browser: and sends the response object back.

MongoDB (to be integrated to Express via Mongoose)

- To run, type “mongosh”.  It is separate from Node.
- db > collections > document === bson object == json object
- No need to specifically initiate db or collection.   Using the db /

Mongoose 

- To run Mongoose, run “node”, and then “.load index.js”.
