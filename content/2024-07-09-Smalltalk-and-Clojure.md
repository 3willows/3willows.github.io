title: "Smalltalk and Clojure: quick start"
---

Before attending a [Smalltalk meetup](https://www.meetup.com/ukstug/) and a [Clojure dojo](https://londonclojurians.org/) this week, I spent the morning getting to the "hello world" stage with these languages.

#### Smalltalk

- After watching [Bernat Romagosa's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlQSm6r3I_g), I chose the [Pharo](https://pharo.org/) variety of Smalltalk. 
- I then followed [Richard Kenneth Eng's tutorial](https://richardeng.medium.com/pharo-quick-start-5bab70944ce2) to dip my toe into the Pharo IDE, itself written in Smalltalk.

#### Clojure

- Having flipped through the first chapters of [Brave Clojure](https://www.braveclojure.com/) before, I was aware of the significant set-up costs.
- Fortunately [Thomas Mattacchione's video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P60dMljS-OM&list=PLaGDS2KB3-ArG0WqAytE9GsZgrM-USsZA&index=1) walked through the process elegantly. 
- After a ["hello world" example](https://github.com/3willows/clojure-hello-world/blob/main/REAMDE.md), I started thinking about potential projects to do.  One candidate is the London Clojurians [landing page](https://londonclojurians.org/) itself, which is missing some photos (recoverable via [the web archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20210623015033/https://londonclojurians.org/)). The source code is [Clojure](https://github.com/ldnclj/landing-page), so could be a good beginner project at the dojo.
